  "minDesc": "Mining represents a deep connection between humanity and the natural world. It reminds us that we are not separate from the earth - we are part of it. We must take care to preserve and protect the fragile ecosystems that sustain us. Mining therefore, is not only as a source of wealth and resources but also as a catalyst for a more sustainable and harmonious relationship between humanity and the planet.",
  "cnstDesc": "There is more to construction than mere necessity and utility. The process of laying down miles of pavement and asphalt is an aesthetic endeavor. From the graceful curves of a mountain pass to the symmetrical patterns of an urban street grid, roads can be strikingly beautiful in their own right, blending seamlessly with the natural environment or creating a bold contrast against it.",
  "rnwDesc": "Renewable energy is a symbol of hope and possibility. As we look to a future that is increasingly defined by the threat of climate change, renewable energy represents a pathway towards a more sustainable and equitable world, one where there is complete harmony between humanity and the natural world. In the end, renewable energy is a source of profound inspiration, a shining example of what humanity can achieve when hearts and minds are united.",
  "ItSDesc": "Applied Science is about finding elegant and efficient ways to use technology to enhance human experience.

  "cnstDescLg": "Construction is the process of creating infrastructure, buildings, and other structures that are essential to the functioning of modern society. From roads and bridges to buildings and tunnels, construction plays a critical role in facilitating economic growth and development. One of the main benefits of construction, outside the utility provided by what is built, is the creation of new jobs and overall economic growth. The construction industry employs millions of people around the world, from architects and engineers to carpenters and electricians. By investing in construction projects, governments and private investors can create new job opportunities, boost local economies, and drive economic growth. Moreover, construction is essential for building and maintaining the infrastructure that we rely on every day. Roads and bridges, for example, allow us to travel and transport goods quickly and efficiently while buildings provide us with shelter, workspaces, and community spaces. Tunnels and other underground structures enable us to access resources such as water, energy, and minerals that are essential to our modern way of life. In addition to these benefits, construction creates spaces that foster community, creativity, and innovation. Buildings, parks, and public spaces provide us with places to gather, socialize, and exchange ideas, while cultural and artistic landmarks inspire us and remind us of our shared humanity. It is important to note however, that construction also has significant environmental impacts. The construction industry is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions and construction projects can have significant impacts on local ecosystems and natural resources. As such, it is critical that we strive to minimize the environmental impacts of construction and adopt more sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy sources and reducing waste. ",
  "rnwDescLg": "Renewable energy is a type of energy that comes from natural resources that are replenished over time, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to environmental pollution, renewable energy is clean, sustainable, and helps mitigate the harmful impacts of climate change. Furthermore, renewable energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions. By relying on clean and sustainable sources of power, we can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, which are the primary drivers of climate change.This, in turn, can help us avoid the impacts of global warming, including rising sea levels, increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters, and the reduction of biodiversity. Renewable energy can improve energy security and resilience. Unlike fossil fuels, which are subject to price volatility and geopolitical tensions, renewable energy is often more locally sourced and less susceptible to supply chain disruptions. This can help countries and communities become more self-sufficient and weather energy crises. Moreover, renewable energy has the potential to spur economic growth and job creation. As the renewable energy industry continues to grow and mature, it is creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs, workers, and investors. In fact, renewable energy is already one of the fastest-growing sectors of the global economy, with the potential to create millions of new jobs in the coming decades. Finally, renewable energy can help promote social justice and environmental equity. Because many renewable energy sources are decentralized and distributed, they can help bring power and opportunity to communities that have historically been marginalized or underserved. This can help create a more inclusive and equitable society, where everyone has access to energy. As we continue to transition to a more sustainable energy future, it is important that we work together to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy technologies and make them more accessible and affordable for all.",
